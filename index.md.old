## The TeliaSonera Innovation Days 2016

*OBS: Det her er et utkast. Vi har fokusert på innhold, ikke på utseende.*

**SHARE | CREATE | INNOVATE**

Transforming to a Next Generation TelCo takes great ideas. Your ideas!
Innovation Days will be an event where people from across the organization meet
to unleash creativity, test and prototype ideas - and have fun!

Follow this web, read your e-mail, or follow our Slack channel to stay
updated. There is a lot going on!

## What

After a period of preparations and registration, we kick off with a few hours of
inspirational talks about innovation, product development, and lean startup
practices from industry experts, open to every employee.

Then up to 100 interested people from across all departments will meet, share their
ideas for new products, services, and other innovations, team around the ideas
that attract them, and work two days on validating them and, as much as possible,
evolving them into prototypes:

1. Pitch your idea - or vote on the one you believe in 
2. Develop the idea in teams - in 48 hours 
3. Present your product, and get your 15 minutes of fame.
   And if that’s not enough: A grand prize!

Finally the best ideas will be voted on and we will see whether we can try to turn
them into real products / services!

*Notice: We run the first Innovation Days as an experiment and it will be
thus limited in scope and locations.*

## Why

A company in the 21st century, with ever more rapidly changing markets, cannot
survive without innovation. Innovation needs to become a part of our culture
and thinking - and we need a space where we can unleash our ideas, without the
stress and limits of daily work life. Innovation Days have three goals:

1. Let people from across the organization work together
2. Make innovation a part of our culture
3. Tap into the vast resource of innovation that our employees are and let them
  work on their latent ideas for new products, services, and improvements

## When & Where

Innovation days will take place in Q1 2016, the dates are yet to be determined.
To come out of the comfort zone and common work thinking, the location will be
somewhere outside of the offices, perhaps the Ullevål Business Center.
