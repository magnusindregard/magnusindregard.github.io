#Ideas
We hope to see many ideas for products, services, and other innovations, preferably within TS focus areas, being validated and turned into prototypes or clear concept descriptions at the event. 

## Criteria:
The submitted ideas should:
- Be relevant to TeliaSonera, by supporting our main strategic areas
- Fulfill/Answer a real need in the market or in our organization
- Add value for our customers or our organization by improving customer experiences, improving our way of work or increasing revenue.
- Be realistic in terms of the time it takes or the cost it demands to realize the idea.

We urge you to submit your idea early so we can pick the right mentors for the event
