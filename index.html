                        <p>A company in the 21st century, with ever more rapidly changing markets, cannot survive without innovation. Innovation needs to become a part of our culture and thinking - and we need a space where we can unleash our ideas, without the stress and limits of daily work life. Innovation Days have three goals:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Let people from across the organization work together</li>
                          <li>Make innovation a part of our internal culture</li>
                          <li>Tap into the vast resource of innovation that our employees are and let them
                          work on their latent ideas for new products, services, and improvements.</li>
                        </ol>
