            <p>As one of the participants:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Pitch your idea - or vote on the one you believe in </li>
              <li>Develop the idea in teams - in 48 hours </li>
              <li>Present your product</li>
              <li>Let the jury votes for the best ones</li>
            </ol>

            <p>We hope to see many ideas for products, services and other innovations,
               preferably within TS focus areas, being
               <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">validated</a>
               and turned into prototypes.

            <p>A company in the 21st century, with ever more rapidly changing markets, cannot
            survive without innovation. Innovation needs to become a part of our culture
            and thinking - and we need a space where we can unleash our ideas, without the
            stress and limits of daily work life. Innovation Days have three goals:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Let people from across the organization work together</li>
              <li>Make innovation a part of our culture</li>
              <li>Tap into the vast resource of innovation that our employees are and let them
              work on their latent ideas for new products, services, and improvements</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Innovation days will take place in Q1 2016, the dates are yet to be determined.</p>
