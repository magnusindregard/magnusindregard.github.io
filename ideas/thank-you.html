                <p>We will use the information to make sure we have the proper mentors for the event.</p>
                <p>When the official registration begins, you will be able to submit the same idea - or a better one. That idea will be available for voting by everyone that has registered. The participants will form groups to develop the best ideas at the event.</p>
